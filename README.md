# Fraud Detection 

This project focuses on developing and evaluating fraud detection models using three real-world datasets: credit card fraud, insurance fraud, and financial fraud detection.

---

## Project Overview

The goal is to identify fraudulent activities using machine learning classification techniques and evaluate their performance with statistical tests.

---

## Key Features

- Developed fraud detection models using:
  - Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset
  - Insurance Fraud Detection dataset
  - Financial Fraud Detection dataset
- Applied comprehensive data preprocessing techniques:
  - Boxplot analysis for outlier detection
  - Feature scaling for normalization
  - SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address class imbalance
- Implemented and compared multiple classification algorithms:
  - Decision Tree
  - Gaussian Naïve Bayes
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Random Forest
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - F1-Score
  - ROC-AUC Curve
- Conducted statistical validation using:
  - Friedman Test
  - Chi-square Test
  - Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test
